## My process

In this challenge I only used HTML, TailwindCSS, and JavaScript didn't use any framework so as not to complicate the configuration

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- TailwindCSS
- JavaScript

### What I learned

By working on this challenge, I was able to learn some important concepts in front-end web development. I learned how to create semantic HTML structures, use Flexbox and grid for responsive layouts, and manage images and text well. In this challenge, I used TailwindCSS for styling, and I also learned how to apply the JavaScript I learned this time. used to validate input and synchronize existing stocks. Overall, this helped improve my understanding of responsive design and best practices in front-end development.
